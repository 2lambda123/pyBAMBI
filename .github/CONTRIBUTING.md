Thank you for considering contributing to pyBAMBI.

If you have a new feature/bug report, make sure you create an [issue](https://github.com/DarkMachines/pyBAMBI/issues) first, in case your suggestion is already being addressed.

If you want to go ahead and create the feature/address the bug yourself, you should fork the repository to you own github account and create a new branch with an appropriate name. Commit any code modifications to that branch, and then create a pull request from that. More detail can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)
